# Gov50: Shiny Example

This is a repo for our Gov 50 students to learn to make a simple Shiny App. 

These resources are very helpful
  - The [Shiny](https://davidkane9.github.io/PPBDS/shiny.html) section of the textbook.
  - This [Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/basic-app.html) book.
  - This [official walkthrough](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/basics.html) to build a complete Shiny App. If you have a couple of free hours one weekend, this would be an **extremely** useful way to spend that time.
